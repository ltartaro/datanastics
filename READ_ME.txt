This project's objective is to provide data anlysis comparation of two datasets.

This is based on statistical parametters and data visualization using Pandas, Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.

The intention here is to merge all this tools at a major routine that makes the same analysis to a large number of samples.

The inicial phase of the project uses two datasets of the same size and format, with 2 dimensions.

Once passing this step, the next one is to take a 3D analysis. Then, we will use two datasets with different shapes and formats.
